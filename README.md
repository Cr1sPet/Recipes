## About the Service

The application is just a simple REST service that allows to perform CRUD operations with kitchen recipes. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store the data. You can also use any other relational database. If your database connection properties work, you can call some REST endpoints defined in ```localhost``` on **port 8080**. (see below)
